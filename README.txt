This is a Feature specifically for Open Atrium and the Time Tracker (drupal.org/project/time_tracker) module.

To enable goto admin/build/modules and enable as you would a module.

Once enabled you will have the following:

  - A menu item and icon in the main features menu that links to the Time Sheet page for the current user. Must have the time_sheet module enabled
  - Additional theming for the time estimate and the time tracker summaries that appear at the top of nodes with time tracking enabled.
